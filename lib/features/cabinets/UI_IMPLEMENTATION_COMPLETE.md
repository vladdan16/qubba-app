## Testing Guide

### Create a New Cabinet
1. Navigate to Cabinets screen
2. Click "+" button (or "Новый" in app bar)
3. Fill in required fields:
   - Name
   - Tax type, tax rate, NDS rate (can use dummy values like 0 for testing)
4. Optionally configure:
   - Organization details
   - Wildberries API
   - Ozon API
5. Click "Создать" (Create)
6. Cabinet should appear in the list

### View Cabinet Details
- Cabinet card displays:
  - Name
  - Active status indicator
  - Marketplace badges (if APIs are active)

### Edit Cabinet
1. Click on a cabinet card
2. Modify any fields
3. Click "Сохранить" (Save)
4. Changes reflected in the list

### Status Indicators
- Green "Активен" badge = Cabinet is active
- Grey "Неактивен" badge = Cabinet is inactive

### Marketplace Integration
- Purple "wb" badge = Wildberries API is active
- Blue "ozon" badge = Ozon API is active
- No badges = No marketplace integrations active

## Notes
- All text is in Russian to match the screenshots
- The form uses simplified validation for now (only name is required)
- API keys are displayed as obscured text for security
- The UI is ready for testing and can be styled further to match Figma designs
- Cabinet IDs are auto-generated from timestamp for new cabinets
- All CRUD operations are fully functional through the API layer

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- More sophisticated tax type/rate selection (dropdowns with predefined values)
- Better validation rules for INN format
- API key validation before saving
- Confirmation dialog before deleting
- More detailed cabinet view screen
- Search and filter functionality
- Sorting options
