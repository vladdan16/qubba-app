# Next Steps for Cabinets Feature

## What Was Done ✅

A complete cabinets management feature has been implemented on the `feature/cabinets` branch with:

- ✅ Complete data layer with API, models, mappers, and repository
- ✅ Complete domain layer with models, repository interface, and BLoC
- ✅ Complete UI layer with list and form screens
- ✅ Integration with dependency injection and routing
- ✅ Full compliance with architecture guidelines
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## What You Need to Do Next 📝

### 1. Create Pull Request
The `feature/cabinets` branch has been merged with all changes from the working branch. You need to:

1. Go to GitHub repository: https://github.com/vladdan16/qubba-app
2. Create a Pull Request from `feature/cabinets` to `main`
3. Review the changes (30 files, ~1,900 lines added)
4. Merge when ready

### 2. Run Code Generation (Required Before Testing)

The feature uses `freezed` and `json_serializable`. Stub files are included, but you should run proper code generation:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/qubba-app/qubba-app
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Or use the project script:
```bash
./codegen.sh
```

### 3. Test the Implementation

After code generation, test the feature:

1. **Navigate to Cabinets Screen**:
   ```
   Navigate to: /cabinets?token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Test List View**:
   - Verify cabinets load from API
   - Check that cards display correctly
   - Verify loading and error states

3. **Test Add Cabinet**:
   - Click the + button
   - Fill in the form
   - Save and verify it appears in the list

4. **Test Edit Cabinet**:
   - Click on a cabinet card
   - Modify fields
   - Save and verify changes

### 4. API Integration Testing

Test with real backend:

1. **GET Request**: Verify `https://bot-api.qubba.io/cabinet/all?limit=1000` works
2. **PUT Request**: Verify `https://user-api.qubba.io/v1/cabinet/{id}` works
3. Check authorization header is properly set by UserDependencies

### 5. Optional: Add Tests

Consider adding:
- Unit tests for BLoCs
- Unit tests for repository
- Widget tests for screens
- Integration tests for full flow

## Documentation

- 📄 `lib/features/cabinets/README.md` - Feature documentation
- 📄 `CABINETS_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md` - Complete implementation summary
- 📄 `IMPORTANT_READ_ME.md` - Code generation instructions

## Routes

- `/cabinets` - List of cabinets
- `/cabinets/add` - Add new cabinet  
- `/cabinets/edit/:id` - Edit existing cabinet

## Key Implementation Details

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ Freezed for data and domain models
- ✅ Built-in sealed classes for BLoC State and Event
- ✅ Clean separation between layers
- ✅ Dio client with pre-configured auth from UserDependencies

### API Endpoints
- GET: `https://bot-api.qubba.io/cabinet/all?limit=1000`
- PUT: `https://user-api.qubba.io/v1/cabinet/{id}`

### State Management
- Domain BLoC: Manages data operations
- UI BLoC: Manages form state (no data layer interaction)
